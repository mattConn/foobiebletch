## What I've Been Up To

In 2017, I left my job as a Web Developer to pursue a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, having come from a background in design with a BS in Communications.

Prior to this, I had begun working lower on the stack as a Web Developer and had come to the realization that there was a lot that I wanted to understand about Software Development and computers overall. Feeling the time was right, I decided a full dive into Computer Science was necessary at the undergraduate level.

I am now a graduate of the College of Staten Island as of Fall 2020 and I've come away with a lot, having spent my time enrolled learning how to program using primarily C++ and discovering a new appreciation for Mathematics, having done an independent study on Differential Geometry.

If you've read this far, thank you for taking the time, and feel free to drop me a line at mattconndev at gmail dot com. I'm currently looking for work as a Software Engineer. I am also working through "Graphs, Networks and Algorithms" by Dieter Jungnickel, I would enjoy discussing that material as well.
