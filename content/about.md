"Foobiebletch" is the name of a scroll from Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, as well as other rougelikes that came before and after. The name does not confer the purpose of the scroll but rather obfuscates it; only after the scroll is read is the scroll's real name revealed and its effects felt, either to the detriment or benefit of the reader.
