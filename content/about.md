_Speaking on JavaScript Game Development at Brooklyn JS, May 2019_

I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Math from the College of Staten Island in Fall 2020.

My favorite programming languages in no particular order are: C/C++, Python, JavaScript and Go. I also have an interest in graph theory which I am currently pursuing.
