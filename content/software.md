## [Sum of Subsets Tree Generator](http://localhost/sum-tree)  
![](/images/graph.png)  
Written in Go and Python, this program will take a numerical sequence and generate all sums of all subsets as an array. This array represents the breadth-first list of sums.  
After being generated with Go, these sums will be passed to a python program that uses networkx to generate an image of the graph.
