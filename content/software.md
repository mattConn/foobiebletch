## [Sum of Subsets Tree Generator](/sum-subsets)  
![](/images/graph.png)  
Written in Go and Python, this program will take a numerical sequence and generate all sums of all subsets as an array. This array represents the breadth-first list of sums.  
After being generated with Go, these sums will be passed to a python program that uses networkx to generate an image of the graph.

## [GitHub Users](/gh-users)  
![](/images/github-users.png)  
Written in Go, this program will display the icons of up to 1,000 GitHub users over a specified range.  
This program simply generates image tags linking images from "avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/$NUMBER".
