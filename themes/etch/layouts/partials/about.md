_Speaking on JavaScript Game Development at Brooklyn JS, May 2019_

I'm a Fall 2020 Computer Science graduate with a minor in Math from the College of Staten Island, looking for my next role as a Software Engineer. Prior to returning to college, I worked as a Frontend Developer for The Charles NYC.

My favorite programming languages in no particular order are: C/C++, Python, JavaScript and Go.
